# My Real Time Application

R Shiny Application setup to monitor enrollment statistics for a university. The actual application lies on the universities Shiny Server, but it can be viewed on my personal page at https://kurtweinheimer.shinyapps.io/myrealtimeapp/. Data has been left out of this repository and it will not be up to date. The script, update CSVs, has been setup on the Shiny Server to run once a day using Crontab.
